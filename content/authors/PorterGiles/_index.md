Porter Giles has been conducting research in the field of Genetic Circuits since March, 2020, under the supervision of Dr. Zhen Zhang. His focus in this research is in studying and creating genetic circuit model abstraction techniques.

Porter was born and raised in Great Falls, Montana, and has been living in Logan, Utah, since 2019. He is working toward his Bachelor degree in Computer engineering and will continue into Utah State's concurrent enrollment program, allowing him to earn credit toward his Masters in Science during his last year of his Bachelor program.

In his free time, Porter likes to dirt bike, play guitar, and learn about Linux.

Research Interests:
My primary interest is in formal verification of concurrent and
probabilistic computing systems. I am interested in developing
theories and algorithms to advance formal and semi-formal verification
techniques in both conventional and stochastic settings, and their
applications in synthetic biology, probabilistic hardware and
distributed protocols, and adversarial perturbations for deep neural networks.

Teaching Interests:
I am interested in contributing to a high standard of teaching at both
the undergraduate and graduate levels. Courses I have sufficient
background to teach include principles of cyber-physical systems,
formal methods, stochastic verification, concurrency theory, digital
logic design, embedded system design, FPGA design, random process,
asynchronous circuit design and synthesis, and modeling and analysis
of synthetic biological systems.

I received my Ph.D. from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Utah in 2001. After working for IBM for three years, I joined the Computer Science and Engineering Department at University of South Florida in 2004. I received an NSF CAREER Award in 2006, an USF Outstanding Research Achievement Award in 2007, and a Best Paper Award in the International SPIN Symposium on Model Checking Software in 2014. I has served in program committees of various conferences, and is currently an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems.

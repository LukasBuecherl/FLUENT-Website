abstract: Synthetic biology research has led to the development of many software tools for designing, constructing, editing, simulating, and sharing genetic parts and circuits. Among these tools are SBOLCanvas, iBioSim, and SynBioHub, which can be used in conjunction to create a genetic circuit design following the design–build–test–learn process. However, although automation works within these tools, most of these software tools are not integrated, and the process of transferring information between them is a very manual, error-prone process. To address this problem, this work automates some of these processes and presents SynBioSuite, a cloud-based tool that eliminates many of the drawbacks of the current approach by automating the setup and reception of results for simulating a designed genetic circuit via an application programming interface.

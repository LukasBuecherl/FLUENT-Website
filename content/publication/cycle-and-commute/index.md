abstract: Rare events are known to potentially cause pathological behavior in biochemical reaction systems. It is important to understand the cause. However, rare events are challenging to analyze due to their extremely low observability. This paper presents a fully automated approach that rapidly generates a large number of execution traces guaranteed to reach user-specified rare-event states for Chemical Reaction Network (CRN) models. It is enabled by a unique combination of a multi-layered and service-oriented CRN formal modeling approach, a dependency graph method to aid the shortest rare-event trace generation, and randomized compositional testing. The resulting prototype tool shows marked improvement over stochastic simulation and probabilistic model checking and it offers insights into a CRN.
